# Automated-Dev-Tools-Installer
A python script that installs a bunch of dev tools for Mac OS using home brew. Typically when starting in a new organisation, a developer has to get a list of all the tools they have to install, versions and install them manually one by one. This scripts makes it easier so that all the user has to do is run script and the predefined apps would be installed.
